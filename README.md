# Cross-Chain Atomic Swaps

Both Alice and Bob lock up the correct amount of tokens in a smart contract on their respective blockchains. Only once both parties put the correct amount of tokens in each smart contract can they be unlocked. Alice receives the digital assets that Bob has originally locked up, and vice versa.
